I'm Dean, currently a *Senior Software Engineer* at *LinkedIn* based in the Bay Area,
California. I've spent over 4 years in the bay working as a leader in the intersection
of Data Science and Big Data Engineering at consulting firms, startups,
and top tech companies such as *Facebook* and *LinkedIn*.

Outside of my career, I spend my time learning and teaching about personal finance
and investing. I've been a serious investor for nearly a decade, making my money
grow and work for me with passive income and good financial management. I've
invested in things like high-yield savings accounts, stocks, options, bonds crypto,
and real estate.

I hope to make this blog a documentation of the things I've learned and a way to
help others progress in their careers and financial lives as much as possible.

### My Data Science and Engineering Experience (4+ years)

I graduated from Reed College in 2016 with a B.A. in Mathematics-Economics. I loved
working with data, statistics, and computer science and knew I wanted to make a career
out of it.

My first forage into the tech world was with a health-tech startup, Nuna Health.
The company's product was a Data Science product that personalized matches for
patients and healthcare providers. I was a Data Scientist by title, but in the
startup world you wear many hats. I not only spent time creating machine learning
solutions but also implementing them in production pipelines to keep the product
running scalably, something that usually falls in the hands of ML/data engineers.

I got a great opportunity to move to Facebook as a Data Scientist to work in their
small business space. There I also worked at the intersection of data science and
engineering. My largest accomplishment was in completely automating a sales reporting
pipeline that reported on millions of advertisers and hundreds of dimensions which
reduced report compilation times from weeks to hours.

Next I decided that I wanted build more on my engineering skills while still
supporting data science efforts. A perfect opportunity came for me at LinkedIn,
where I am now. I support a marketing data science team in their data foundations.

**Throughout my career, I have given and participated in dozens of interviews for
both data science and data engineering. In addition to Nuna, Facebook, LinkedIn,
I've also done and passed interviews at Netflix, Apple, Houzz, and various other
startups.**
