  <h1> A Comprehensive Resouce For Personal Finance, Investing, and a Career in Data </h1>

  This is a place for me to share all the knowledge I've accumulated about
  personal finance, investing, and my career in data in the tech industry.

  <h3> Where to start? </h3>
  You can start by learning more <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about"> about me </a>
  as the author of this site.
  <br><br>
  I strongly believe in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/financial-minimalism">
  financial minimalism </a> and how it creates the financial freedom to live a
  more stress free and fulfilling life.
  <br><br>
  With nearly half a decade of experience in the tech industry, I also believe in
  extensive preparation to land your dream job in data. As both an interviewer
  and interviee at several Silicon Valley tech companies including Facebook and
  LinkedIn, I've written tons of resources for you on how to best prepare for
  the interview process.
