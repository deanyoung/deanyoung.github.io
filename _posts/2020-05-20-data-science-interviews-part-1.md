### The Recruiter Screen

**Interview length: 30 minutes**

This interview usually consists of a recruiter chatting with you
for 20-30 minutes about your background and collaboratively figuring out if you're
a good fit for the company and role and vice versa.

While this interview isn't difficult, it's very important to get right. Come in
with a good story about why you're ready to move to a new role and how this role
and company is a great fit. For example, when I interviewed at Facebook, I explained
how I wanted to work on a product that was used by the typical person and that
my work would have more immediate impact rather than waiting for years (my previous
company worked with insurance companies).

Make sure you have a strong but **brief (< 2 minutes)** elevator pitch about your
background.

My pitch: *I was encouraged by my college professors to enter the
data world since technology has gotten so powerful it's enabled society to answer
important questions with data like never before. I want to contribute to this growth.
Throughout my career, I work at the intersection of data science and engineering,
ensuring that I have the business context and analytical framework to solve
critical business problems while also having the engineering skills to scale and
implement the solutions.*

There's no need to lie or fake your enthusiasm for a role. I've been in recruiting
screens where I express that the role at hand wasn't the best fit for me and the
recruiter found a better matching role for me to interview at. This screen is a
two way street and it helps to ensure that the role you interview for is a good
fit for you.
