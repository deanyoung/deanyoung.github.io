### A comprehensive interview guide to get Data Science roles at top tech companies written by a former Data Scientist and interviewer at Facebook

<img src="{{ site.imgsrc }}/{{ page.slug }}/data-science-interview.png">

I have been interviewing at and giving interviews for startups and top tech companies
for several years now. I've noticed that while the questions and contexts may be
different between companies, they tend to test for very similar skills and concepts.
The set of modules, or types of interview such as data transformation, data analytics, etc.
tend to be roughly similar. Especially for larger tech companies, these modules
are standardized so that review committees can compare across candidates.

I'm here to share a general overview of the interview process and what you should
expect and prepare for. In future posts, I will be adding walkthroughs of specific
example technical interview questions.
