### The Onsite

**Interview length: 4-6 hours (4-6 rounds 1 hour each)**

*Note: With the current COVID-19 pandemic, almost all companies are conducting the
"onsite" interviews remotely but the general format is the typically the same*

The onsite is where the company tries to get a full picture of your capabilities.
Your performance overall here will not only determine if you get an offer but also
what your level and compensation will be so it's critical to be at your best here.

You will likely go through multiple (4-6 rounds) of interviews each with different
people in the team or org, from ICs to managers. There's a fairly broad coverage
and the specific types of interviews can vary company by company. Your recruiter
can give you specific details of what each interview will cover. Generally, you
can expect some combination of the following types of interviews.

##### Data Transformation, Extended
This will be very similar to the Data Transformation interview from the technical screen
[(Part 2: The Technical Screen)]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/data-science-interviews-part-2/), except the questions will be more difficult and take longer to complete.
They will typically be composed of multiple parts and have more complex input tables.
It typically takes you the entire hour to finish all the parts.

Often, the recruiter will be able to pass along feedback from your technical screen
that you can use to practice and shore up any weaknesses prior to the onsite. This
is a great way to gather information about what the company is looking for in your
skills. For example, the recruiter may tell you that your interviewer felt you
didn't ask enough about potential null values or missing data, indicating that
the company has messy data and needs someone who knows how to handle it.

##### Data Case Studies, Extended
This will also be very similar to the Data Case Study interview from the technical
screen. Again, it will be an extended version and cover much broader questions
that have no single definitive answer and can be discussed for up to an hour.

In many companies you will actually do two rounds of this with different interviewers
as this specific interview gives the company a lot of signal on your critical thinking
abilities and helps them to determine your leveling. Someone who demonstrates
that they can solve business problems with good data design will be leveled higher
than someone who struggles since it's a proxy for real world experience.

The preparation is the same as for the technical screen, make sure to practice
as many example questions as you can think of. Also, keep in mind that with
increased time, interviews may be more aggressive in tacking on additional questions
or pushing back against your answers. For example, if the question is about how
you would create Netflix recommendations, they may follow up with, how would you
determine if a recommendation set is working for a user and how would you update
the recommendations if they aren't? Don't be discouraged by this, as long as you
acknowledge and continue to build your answer, this will be taken as a good signal.
